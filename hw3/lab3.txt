Assignment 3 Log
=================================

1.
----------
Initially, I used wget to grab each of the required files 
and placed them all into the same folder:
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig
wget https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-keyring.gpg

I then ran the given command: 
gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig

This gave the following output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: checking the trustdb
gpg: no ultimately trusted keys found
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.
Primary key fingerprint: 6C37 DC12 121A 5006 BC1D  B804 DF6F D971 3060 37D9

This information means that the file was signed by Pádraig Brady, but there
is no signiture from a trusted third party used to verify that Brady was
indeed the person who signed the document. Someone else may have claimed
to be him and spoofed his signature, but since the file was from a 
trusted source (the gnu webside itself) this is very unlikely.
It is up to users to decide whether to trust that the signature is valid.

2.
----------
To extract the tar .file, I used:
tar -xvf coreutils-8.29.tar.xz
This extracts all of the files and places them in the folder "coreutils-8.29"
After entering this directory, I read through the README and INSTALL files and
learned that I needed to run the following commands to install into
a custom directory I created earlier, tempCoreutils:
./configure --exec-prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/guevara/Desktop/CS35L/hw3/tempCoreutils
make
make install
The first command configures the package for the system and specifies the 
build path, the "make" command compiles the program, and "make install"
installs the compiled program into the assigned directory. 

3.
----------
After switching directories to ./tempCoreutils, running the command
./bin/ls -a -A
reproduces the bug, and outputs 4 the files ".  ..  bin  libexec"
when the output should simply be "bin libexec"

4.
----------
To patch the file, I navigated to my ./hw3/coreutils-8.29 directory.
I then created a file patchfile.patch and copied the contents from the 
I then ran the command:
patch -p1 <patchfile.patch
which automatically installed each of the patches.

5.
----------
Initially, running "make" threw a bunch of errors, so I ran "autoreconf -f -i"
as suggested on Piazza then ran "make" again, and it then worked.
Only the few files related to the patch file were modified, so the make file
only changed those files. 

6.
----------
Moving back to my ./hw3 home directory, I ran each of the following commands:
./tempCoreutils/bin/ls -a -A
./coreutils-8.29/bin/ls -a -A

The first command was still functioning incorrectly, and includes the ". .."
directories in the list. However, the updated ls command in coreutils-8.29
does not have the same issue, as it has been patched to work correctly.
