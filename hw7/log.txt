Lab 7: log.txt
====================

My partner for this lab was Kameron Carr.

To begin, I installed the necessary drivers onto my Windows laptop for
the BeagleBone. This involved a roundabout process of disabling driver
authentication in my OS then running the installation drivers.
From there, I used PuTTY to connect to the board directly then followed the
instructions listed on Piazza and connected to the classroom wifi then 
downloaded the necessary software. 

From there, I created a user for my partner to connect by running the commands:

# create the user "guest"
sudo useradd -d /home/guest -m guest

# set the password to "password"
sudo passwd guest

# give the user permissions to a .ssh directory 
cd /home/guest
sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R guest .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

Then, I used ifconfig to determine my BeagleBone's IP address, then provided
the IP, username, and password to my partner. He was able to connect to my 
board.  

My partner performed the same setup steps as I did (down to the username and
password). To connect to his BeagleBone, I used the following commands:

# Create a pair of keys
ssh-keygen

# copy to his BeagleBone
ssh-copy-id -i guest@10.97.85.51

# add private key to authentication agent then verify it works
ssh-add
eval `ssh-agent`

# connect to the BeagleBone using ssh
ssh -X guest@10.97.85.51

From there, I ran "xterm" to verify that I could open a window. 
I then disconnected using "exit".
