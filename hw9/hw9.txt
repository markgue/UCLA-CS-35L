Assignment 9: hw9.txt
===================================
1. Maintain a hw9.txt
---
This is the hw9.txt file!


2. Check out the version, new branch "quote"
---
cd diffutils
git checkout -b 'quote' 'v3.0'


3. Install new branch with patch
---
I ran the following command: 
patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

Output:
patching file src/analyze.c
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/context.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/side.c
patching file src/util.c


4. Learn Emacs add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a)
---
I read through the provided link to learn the commands.


5. Use emacs to make a ChangeLog
---
I opened emacs, then created a ChangeLog file with C-x 4 a.
The ChangeLog contains the following information:

2018-06-07  Mark Andrew Guevara  <guevara@lnxsrv03.seas.ucla.edu>

        * Updated quotation marks stylization from `---' to '---' in the
        following files:
        * src/analyze.c
        * src/cmp.c
        * src/context.c
        * src/diff.c
        * src/diff3.c
        * src/dir.c
        * src/sdiff.c
        * src/side.c
        * src/util.c


6. Commit changes
---
I ran the commands:
git add .
git commit -F ChangeLog

The command "git log" confirms that the patch was applied. 


7. git format-patch
---
git format-patch --stdout -1 > ../formatted-patch.txt


8. Verify partner's files
---
I created a branch "partner" then applied the patch:
git checkout -b 'partner' 'v3.0'

I then used my partner's formatted-patch.txt (which I renamed to partner-formatted-patch.txt) to apply the patch:
git am < partner-formatted-patch.txt

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

The patch worked.

I verified the changes the same way as in the lab, with ./src/diff . - and ./src/diff --help.
Both had the correct quotations.

I ran the command "make distdir", which created a folder diffutils-3.0.1-0407.
The file diffutils-3.0.1-0407/ChangeLog has my patch, meaning everything worked:

                following files:
                * src/analyze.c
                * src/cmp.c
                * src/context.c
                * src/diff.c
                * src/diff3.c
                * src/dir.c
                * src/sdiff.c
                * src/side.c
                * src/util.c

I entered the folder and ran gitk:
cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
gitk

This opened a window through Xming, which I had previously configured with PuTTY.
I scrolled through and found patches around the date 2015-01-25.

There is a merge on 2015-01-25 by joakim Verona:
