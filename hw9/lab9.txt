Assignment 9: lab9.txt
===================================
1. Get a copy of Diffutils
---
git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git


2. Get a log of changes
---
cd diffutils
git log > ../git-log.txt


3. Generate a list of tags
---
git tag > ../git-tag.txt


4. Find commit “maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'”
---
git log --grep "maint: quote"

Outputs:
commit 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f
Author: Paul Eggert <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>
Date:   Wed Jan 25 23:46:16 2012 -0800

    maint: quote 'like this' or "like this", not `like this'
...


From there, I used the given commit ID: 
git format-patch -1 --stdout 62ca21c8c1a5aa3488589dcb191a4ef04ae9ed4f > ../quote-patch.txt


5. Check version 3.0
---
git checkout v3.0


6. apply quote-patch.txt
---
patch -p1 < ../quote-patch.txt

The patcher was unsure whether to patch the following files. I skipped them with RETURN.
a/HACKING , b/HACKING
a/doc/diffutils.texi , b/doc/diffutils.texi


7. Use git status
---
git status

Output:

        src/system.h.orig
        src/util.c.orig
        tests/help-version.orig

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

According to git status, the patch modified a large number of files.


8. Use Emacs vc-diff and vc-revert 
---
Using vc-diff (C-x v =) then describe-mode (C-h m), I read about the different commands available
that allow for reverting changes.


9. Use Emacs to revert changes to non .c files
---
I opened the following files individually in emacs then ran vc-revert (C-x v u) to discard the changes:
NEWS
README
TODO
doc/diagmeet.note
ms/config.bat
ms/config.site
po/en.po
src/diff.h
src/system.h
tests/help-version

For the .c files, I opened them individually in emacs, then ran vc-diff (C-x v =) to open the buffer, then
reverted each of the changes using (C-u C-c C-a), which reverts the changes that diff-apply-hunk (C-c C-a)
would apply:

src/analyze.c
src/cmp.c
src/context.c
src/diff.c
src/diff3.c
src/dir.c
src/ifdef.c
src/io.c
src/sdiff.c
src/side.c
src/util.c


10. Use exmacs to examine src/*.c.rej
---
The src/*.c.rej files are diff3.c.rej and diff.c.rej. The line numbers do not match the actual locations
in each file, which is the cause of the rejection. I manually opened each file and searched for each change.
diff3.c requires one change.
diff.c requires five total changes.
After applying the changes, I saved the files and exited.


11. Remove untracked files
---
From the above list, all of the untracked files are either .diff or .orig files. I used the following commands
to remove them from the directory:

find . -type f -name '*.orig' -delete
find . -type f -name '*.rej' -delete
find . -type f -name '#*#' -delete

The last command was to remove a few emacs autosave files that I had accidentally created.

git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt


12. Check git status and git diff
---
git status now only shows the following output: 
HEAD detached at v3.0
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

        modified:   src/analyze.c
        modified:   src/cmp.c
        modified:   src/context.c
        modified:   src/diff.c
        modified:   src/diff3.c
        modified:   src/dir.c
        modified:   src/sdiff.c
        modified:   src/side.c
        modified:   src/util.c

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

Since there are no untracked files, it is ready to be committed. 

I ran the following command to create quote-3.0-patch.txt:
git diff > ../quote-3.0-patch.txt


13. Build resulting version
---
The README-hacking states to use the following commands:
        $ ./bootstrap
        $ ./configure
        $ make
        $ make check

I ran those commands in order. Since I was on lnxsrv03, no additional patch was needed.
I used the following commands to verify the patch:
./src/diff . -
./src/diff --help

The output of these files shows all of the quotations as '', not `', so the patch was applied correctly.


14. Use diff to compare 3.0 to modified version
---
I first made the needed directories:
cd ..
mkdir diffutils-3.0
mkdir diffutils-3.0-patch

Next I copied over all of the necessary files into their respective folders:

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git diffutils-3.0
cp -r diffutils diffutils-3.0-patch

I then created folders in each of the directories that only contained the modified .c files:

cd diffutils-3.0
mkdir csource
cp ./src/*.c ./csource/
cd ..

cd diffutils-3.0-patch
mkdir csource
cp ./src/*.c ./csource/
cd ..

I then ran a modified version of the given command so that it would only compare the .c files:

./diffutils/src/diff -pru diffutils-3.0/csource/ diffutils-3.0-patch/csource/ > quote-3.0-text.txt


15. Compare quote-3.0-test.txt and quote-3.0-patch.txt
---
diff -u quote-3.0-test.txt quote-3.0-patch.txt

The list of differences is very large, but a majority seem to be due to a misalignment of the information
stored in each file. It contains all of the changes to quotation marks, and the remaining changes are 
all innocuous.
