===================================
The top left corner shows a visual of the different branches, with the left-most branch
being the master branch. Each merge connects two of the branches across the vertical lines,
and each commit is recorded with a name, email, and date to the right. 
The bottom right subwindow shows the patch information, giving the patch hash as well as the hashes
of the parent and child commits. Below this information, the diff file is displayed and can be searched
through using the search bar. The main window on the bottom right shows all files that have been modified
in the selected commit.
